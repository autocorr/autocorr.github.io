### Welcome

I am a first year astronomy graduate student at [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu) studying the earliest phases of high mass star formation with my adviser [Yancy Shirley](http://eldora.as.arizona.edu/~yshirley/). I am also a team member of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey ([BGPS](http://milkyway.colorado.edu/bgps/)) collaboration. My research interests center on star formation, radio astronomy, and astrochemistry.
