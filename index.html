<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I am a Jansky fellow at the NRAO in Socorro. I study the earliest phases of high-mass star-formation with my adviser <a href="http://eldora.as.arizona.edu/~yshirley/index.html">Yancy Shirley</a>. I am also a team member of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (<a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM_GPS/">BGPS</a>) collaboration. My research interests center on star-formation, astrochemistry, and radio astronomy.</p>
