<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I am an Assistant Staff Scientist of the <a href="https://nrao.edu">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> in Socorro, NM. I completed my thesis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://eldora.as.arizona.edu/~yshirley/index.html">Yancy Shirley</a> in 2018, where I was an NSF GRFP Fellow. From 2018 to 2021 I was a Jansky Postdoctoral Fellow of the NRAO. My research focuses on developing innovative techniques to study the dense, molecular interstellar medium of the Milky Way. I use observations from the worlds <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/">largest</a> <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/">radio</a> <a href="https://greenbankobservatory.org/">telescopes</a> and astrostatistics to understand the earliest evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation. I am also passionate about developing observational methods and open source software tools for radio astronomical applications (see my <a href="code.html">code</a> page for more details).</p>
