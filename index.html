<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I am a Jansky Postdoctoral Fellow of the <a href="https://nrao.edu">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a>, Socorro, NM. My research interests include star formation, the interstellar medium, astrochemistry, and radio astronomy techniques. I completed my thesis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://eldora.as.arizona.edu/~yshirley/index.html">Yancy Shirley</a> in 2018 investigating starless clump candidates and the earliest phases of high-mass star formation in the Milky Way. I am a team member in the ALMA Large Programs ALMA-IMF and <a href="http://stars.riken.jp/faust/fausthome.html">FAUST</a>.</p>
