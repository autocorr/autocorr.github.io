<h3>Links</h3>
<p>I try to bookmark and sort the research related web pages I visit. If you
would like import the bookmarks into your web-browser, you can use my HTML
formatted <a href="bookmarks.html">bookmarks file</a>. For general browsing you
can see the exported copy below. (Last updated: 26-06-2013)</p>

<hr><center>Bookmarks :: Begin</center><hr>
{% include bookmarks_content.html %}
<hr><center>Bookmarks :: End</center><hr>
