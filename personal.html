<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Although not known for its <a href="http://cleardarksky.com/c/GrhmWAkey.html?1">numerous sunny days</a>, I grew up in the beautiful Northwest in Puyallup, Washington. My passion for astronomy grew out of my general curiousity about how things work and the encouragement and support I received from my parents. As an avid amateur astronomy, my trust Meade LX10 and I have scanned the skies together since middle school. I received my B.S. in Physics from <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/physics/">Western Washington University</a> in 2012 before arriving in sunny Tucson.</p>
