<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Although not known for its numerous sunny days, I grew up in the beautiful Pacific Northwest in Puyallup, Washington. My passion for astronomy developed out of a curiousity for our origins and the encouragement and support I received from my parents. As an avid amateur astronomy, my trusty Meade LX10 and I have scanned the skies together since middle school. I received my B.S. in Physics from <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/physics/">Western Washington University</a> (WWU) in 2012 and my Ph.D. from the University of Arizona in 2018.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>My dual interest to our cosmic origins is our historical origins here on Earth. While the history of human endeavor is fascinating in itself, I feel strongly that we have an obligation to study the people's of the past so that we may learn from them, understand them, and remember them.</p>
<p>I also enjoy reading ancient history and studying the world's cultures. Although I have done the most reading on the Ancient Roman and Mediterranean world, I am especially interested in the ancient cultures of the Americas. Some of my favorite people's of the past include (roughly grouped geographically and with cultural groups mixed with empires):
I think all history is fascinating and each people worthy of study&#8212;any I have left out are simply ones I have yet to learn more about! Currently on my reading list are the Hittites and Kushans.</p>
