<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Although not known for its numerous sunny days, I grew up in the beautiful Northwest in Puyallup, Washington. My passion for astronomy grew out of a curiousity about how things work and the encouragement and support I received from my parents. As an avid amateur astronomy, my trusty Meade LX10 and I have scanned the skies together since middle school. I received my B.S. in Physics from <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/physics/">Western Washington University</a> in 2012 before arriving in sunny Tucson.</p>

I also enjoy reading ancient history and studying the world's cultures throughout the continuity of human experience. Although I have done the most reading on the Ancient Roman world, some of my favorite people's of the past include: the rich cultures of Ancient Greece from the Minoans to the Byzantines; the flourishing cultures of ancient Mesoamerica such as the Olmec, Maya, Mexica, and Zapotec; the numerous and vibrant cultures of the Bronze Age across the Old World; the cradles of Western civilization in the Fertile Crescent; and the great sea-faring peoples of Phoenicia and Carthage. I think all history is fascinating and each people worthy of study -- any I have left out are simply ones I have yet to learn more about!
