<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Although not known for its numerous sunny days, I grew up in the beautiful Northwest in Puyallup, Washington. My passion for astronomy grew out of a curiousity about how things work and the encouragement and support I received from my parents. As an avid amateur astronomy, my trusty Meade LX10 and I have scanned the skies together since middle school. I received my B.S. in Physics from <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/physics/">Western Washington University</a> (WWU) in 2012 before arriving in sunny Tucson.</p>

<h3> Ancient History </h3>
<p>I also enjoy reading ancient history and studying the world's cultures. Although I have done the most reading on the Ancient Roman and Mediterranean world, I am especially interested in the ancient cultures of the Americas. Some of my favorite people's of the past include (roughly grouped geographically and with cultural groups mixed with empires):
<ul>
	<li>Mediterranean: Minoan, Mycenaean, Classical Greek, Byzantine, Etruscan, Roman, Carthaginian, Hittite</li>
	<li>Fertile Crescent: Sumerian, Egyptian, Akkadian, Hittite, Assyrian, Phoenician</li>
	<li>Central Asia: Greco-Bactria, Kushan</li>
	<li>Indian: Harrapan/IVC, Mauryan, Gupta</li>
	<li>North American: Hohokam, ancient Pueblo, Mississippian</li>
	<li>Mesoamerican: Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, Toltec, Mexica</li>
	<li>Andean: Norte Chico, Chav&iacute;n, Moche, Tiwanaku, Wari, Chim&uacute;, Inka</li>
</ul>
I think all history is fascinating and each people worthy of study&#8212;any I have left out are simply ones I have yet to learn more about! Currently on my reading list are the Hittites and Kushans.</p>
