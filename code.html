<h3>My Code</h3>
<p>The software programs for my research are primarily written in Python but also include code written in C, Cython, Julia, and IDL. The code for my projects is available on my <a href="https://github.com/autocorr">GitHub page</a> as free software under the GNU GPL. I am also an enthusiast of programming languages and have dabbled with Racket, Rust, Smalltalk, and Forth, among others.</p>

<h3>Free Software</h3>
<p>I feel strongly about broadening the availability of research tools used by students and researchers to analyze their data. Although the scientific community embraces publicly released data and open-access publications, the code and software that researchers use to determine their findings is largely hidden and proprietary. I believe that <a href="http://fsf.org">free</a> and open-source software benefits the entire scientific community, empowers the public, and makes results more easily independently verifiable.</p>

<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
<p>GNU/Linux (or simply Linux) is a family of free and open-source operating systems. I have been a Linux enthusiast since 2006 and run <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> on most of my systems. I prefer and enjoy Linux as an operating system because it empowers the user to modify the software on their computer and share those changes with others.</p>
