<h3>Free Software</h3>
<p>I feel strongly about broadening the availability of research tools used by
students and researchers to analyze their data. Although the scientific
community embraces publicly released data and open-access publications, the
code and software that researchers use to determine their findings is largely
hidden and proprietary. I believe that <a href="http://fsf.org">free</a>
and open-source software benefits the entire scientific community, empowers the
public, and makes results more easily independently verifiable.</p>

<h3>My Code</h3>
<p>You can find my code released under the GNU General Public License on
<a href="http://github.com/autocorr">my github page</a> largely in my personal
library <a href="http://github.com/autocorr/besl">besl</a>. I code primarily
in Python but occasionally use IDL, C++, and Julia. I've also dabbled
with Haskell, Fortran 77, Perl, Golang, and Smalltalk.</p>

<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
<p>GNU/Linux (or simply Linux) is a family of free and open-source operating
systems. I have been a Linux enthusiast since 2006 and run
<a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> or
<a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>
on most of my systems. I prefer and
enjoy Linux as an operating system because it empowers the user to modify the
software on their computer and share those changes with others.</p>
