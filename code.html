<h3>My Code</h3>
<p>The software programs for my research are primarily written in Python but also include code written in Cython, IDL, and Julia. The code for my projects is available on my <a href="https://github.com/autocorr">GitHub page</a> as free software under the GNU GPL. I am also an enthusiast of programming languages and have dabbled with Racket, Rust, Smalltalk, and Forth, among others.</p>

<h3>Free Software</h3>
<p>I feel strongly about broadening the availability of research tools used by students and researchers to analyze their data. Although the scientific community embraces publicly released data and open-access publications, the code and software that researchers use to determine their findings is largely hidden and proprietary. I believe that <a href="http://fsf.org">free</a> and open-source software benefits the entire scientific community, empowers the public, and makes results more easily independently verifiable.</p>

<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
<p>GNU/Linux (or simply Linux) is a family of free and open-source operating systems. I have been a Linux enthusiast since 2006 and run <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> on most of my systems. I prefer and enjoy Linux as an operating system because it empowers the user to modify the software on their computer and share those changes with others.</p>
