title: Visit and R&G Lunch Talk at SAO/CfA
---

I'll be visiting the Harvard/Smithsonian CfA to collaborate with SMA fellow [Dr. Cara Battersby](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~cbattersby/) between June 4-16. I'll also be presenting my research at the Radio and Geoastronomy Division lunch talk series on Friday June 12 at 12:30 pm. I am more than happy to meet and discuss research, so if you're interested, please send me an email.
