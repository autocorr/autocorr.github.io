title: Soul of High-Mass Star Formation
---

I'll be giving a talk at the [Soul of High-Mass Star Formation](http://www.das.uchile.cl/star-formation/) meeting in Puerto Varas, Chile, between March 15-20. My talk will present the results of comparing the physical conditions of BGPS clumps associated to different observational indicators of star-formation. In addition we identify and characterize a large sample of starless clump candidates.
