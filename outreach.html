<h2>Public Outreach and Service</h2>
<p>I have been fortunate to share my passion for sharing the night-sky,
astronomy, and science with the public through contributing to a variety of
public outreach events. I work with Arizona Statue University's School of Earth
and Space Exploration (SESE) and the Tucson Amateur Astronomy Association
(TAAA) for community outreach. Below are a broad list of my outreach
