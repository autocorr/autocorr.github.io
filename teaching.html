<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
<p>I have had the good fortune to gain experience in pedagogy from the University of Arizona's <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/center-astronomy-education">Center for Astronomy Education</a>. I was a teaching assistant at the University of Arizona Astronomy Department during the 2015/2016 academic year and the 2018 Spring semester. As a Jansky Fellow I have taught as a guest lecturer at Amherst College.</p>
