<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My research is focused on observational studies of star and cluster forming environments in the molecular interstellar medium, and in particular, those showing no observational signatures of star formation activity.
As part of my research, I investigate:
<ol>
	<li>the physical properties of dense molecular regions through statistical analyses of datasets from Galactic Plane surveys</li>
	<li>the sub-structure at high-resolution of cluster-forming regions to understand the physical mechanisms controlling fragmentation</li>
	<li>the core mass function before the (proto-)stellar feedback of high-mass stars</li>
	<li>the dynamical collapse motions of gas in protoclusters at early evolutionary phases.</li>
</ol>
I have also developed expertise with astrophysical techniques such as radiative transfer modeling, mid-infrared extinction mapping, Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo methods.</p>

<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>I am developing <a href="https://casa.nrao.edu">CASA</a> tools for joint deconvolution of single-dish and interferometric imaging and automatic mask creation for spectral lines with hyperfine structure.</p>
