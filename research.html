<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Advances in sensitivity and resolution from cutting edge radio observatories
such as the GBT, JVLA, and ALMA are enabling the study of the earliest,
coldest, and most deeply embedded phases of high-mass star formation. I am
interested in studying the properties of the molecular cloud "clumps" that
precursors to stellar clusters. Because high-mass stars uniquely form in
clusters, these regions represent the initial conditions of high-mass star
formation. What are their physical and chemical properties? How do gas flows
feed the growth of high-mass stars? Do high-mass (&gt;40 solar masses) starless
cores exist? How do clumps fragment into a population of cores?</p>

<h3>Water Masers in High-Mass Star Forming Regions</h3>
<p>In the GBT BGPS ammonia and water maser survey we present targeted
observations toward over 1780 clumps in a variety of evolutionary stages. We
calculate mean gas kinetic temperatures from simultaneous observataion of the
(1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) inversion transitions of ammonia. These temperatures
provide essential information in calculating accurate masses from dust
continuum emission. We also provide a catalog of 472 22 GHz water maser
spectra, 343 of which have no counterpart in the published surveys from the
Mopra and Arcetri observatories. We find that the water maser provides a unique
sign-post of star formation activity when compared with existing catalogs of
color-selected YSO's (Lumsden et al. 2013, Robitaille et al. 2008): 25% of
clumps that host water masers do not have cataloged IR activity. This work was
included in &sect;2 and &sect;3 in

<h3>Physical Properties of Massive Starless and Star-forming Clumps</h3>
<p>The evolutinoary sequence of high-mass star forming systems is more poorly
understood than low-mass systems because they are far away, deeply embedded,
environmentally complex, and have until very recently not had blind, systematic
surveys from which to measure their properties. Using the BGPS and a wide
variety of Galactic plane surveys, we categorize clumps into evolutionary
stages from a diverse set of sign-posts of star formation activity, including
water masers, methanol masers, color-selected YSOs, UCHII regions, and HiGal 70
micron point sources.

<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>I am also interested in the tools and techniques of radio astronomy, both
single-dish and interferometry, and supporting the astronomical community
through the development of observational methods and software.</p>
