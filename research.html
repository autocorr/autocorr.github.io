<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Advances in sensitivity and resolution from cutting edge radio observatories
such as the GBT, ALMA, and the JVLA are enabling the study of the earliest,
coldest, and most deeply embedded phases of high-mass star formation. I am
interested in determining the physical and chemical properties of high-mass
star forming molecular cloud "clumps" in different evolutionary stages. A goal
of this research is to also systematically uncover a population of high-mass
pre-protoclusters or "starless clumps."</p>

<p>Below you can find short summaries of the research projects that I have worked
on. If you have any questions, comments, or interest in collaboration, please

<h3>Water Masers in High-Mass Star Forming Regions</h3>
<p>The GBT BGPS ammonia and water maser has observed over 1500 clumps in a variety
of evolutionary stages. We calculate mean gas kinetic temperatures from
simultaneous observataion of the (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) inversion transitions
of ammonia. The water maser provides a unique sign-post of star formation
in classifying clumps by evolutionary stage. We find that for existing publicly
available catalogs of color-selected YSO's (Lumsden et al. 2013, Robitaille et
al. 2008), 25% host water masers but do not have cataloged IR activity.</p>

<h3>The Physical Properties of Clumps in Different Evolutionary Stages</h3>
<p>The evolutinoary sequence of high-mass star forming systems is more poorly
understood than low-mass systems because they are far away, deeply embedded,
environmentally complex, and have until very recently not had blind, systematic
surveys from which to measure their properties. Using the BGPS and a wide
variety of Galactic plane surveys, we categorize clumps into evolutionary
stages from a diverse set of sign-posts of star formation activity, including
water masers, methanol masers, color-selected YSOs, UCHII regions, and HiGal 70
micron point sources.</p>

<h3>Deuteration in Starless Clumps</h3>
<p>Coming Soon!</p>

<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>I am also interested in the tools and techniques of radio astronomy, both
single-dish and interferometry, and supporting the astronomical community
through the development of observational methods and software.</p>
