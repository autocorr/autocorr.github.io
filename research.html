<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Advances in sensitivity and resolution from cutting edge radio observatories
such as the GBT, ALMA, and the JVLA are enabling the study of the earliest,
coldest, and most deeply embedded phases of high-mass star formation. I am
interested in determining the physical and chemical properties of high-mass
star forming molecular cloud "clumps" in different evolutionary stages. A goal
of this research is to also systematically uncover a population of high-mass
pre-protoclusters or "starless clumps."</p>

<h3>Origins of the most Massive Stars</h3>
<p>The most massive stars are the primary actors in galaxy evolution and
drastically affect the environments that form planetary and stellar systems.
High-mass stars drive the heating and turbulence in the interstellar medium as
well enrich the interstellar medium with heavy elements that are the dominant
coolant.  Despite the importance of high-mass stars, their formation is poorly
understood due to observational difficulty. Compared to low-mass, high-mass
star forming regions are more distant, are deeply embedded in their natal
clouds, and have shorter time-scales for critical evolutionary phases. However,
we live in an exciting age where, for the first time, sensitive surveys of our
Galaxy are taking place in a variety of wavelengths and observational probes of
star formation.  My research focuses on the recently publicly released Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS).  The BGPS used the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory (CSO) to observe 1.1mm radio continuum of cool dust in molecular
cloud "clumps."  The BGPS reveals the most complete census to date of high-mass
star forming regions in all stages of evolution throughout our Galaxy.</p>

<h3>Starless Clumps in the BGPS</h3>
<p>My research aims to determine the physical properties (temperature, mass,
size, etc.) of high-mass star forming regions from the BGPS to determine how
these properties change based on the region's evolutionary stage.  In the
search for the earliest phase of high-mass star formation, the so-called
"pre-protoclusters" or "starless clumps," I have compared the regions in the
BGPS to a variety of observations known to be "sign-posts" of star formation
activity.  These sign-posts range from infrared observations of young
protostars, water and methanol masers, molecular outflows, and ultra-compact
HII regions.  Water masers occur in the outflows of young, newly forming stars
and their presence strongly suggests that the region as a whole is undergoing
active star formation. I have reduced and analyzed a sample of ~1400 water
maser spectra from the 100m Green Bank Telescope, the largest such set of such
observations taken from a blind survey.  Since starless clumps are not expected
to host water masers, these data provide a sensitive sign-post of
star-formation activity in addition to those found in publicly available
surveys.</p>

<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>I am also interested in the tools and techniques of radio astronomy, both
single-dish and interferometry, and supporting the astronomical community
through the development of observational methods and software.</p>
